SeoServer

=========

SeoServer is an independent tool that allows Web Crawlers to crawl your ajax content. Works great with javascript applications built with things like Backbone.js etc

It simply redirects web crawlers to another server, this server runs a headless browser that renders your page and returns the full html with dynamic templates included (just like in the browser). 

## Getting started

SeoServer uses Phantom.js for it's headless browserness
